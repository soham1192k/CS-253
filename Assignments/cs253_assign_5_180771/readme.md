You should pick some individual or organization, and write a factual summary (about 500 words). You must produce the writeup in Latex, and the summary should be described with the help of at least five different types of plots. You must be careful to pick the right plot in each case to well illustrate the claim that you want to make. You may collect data from any source, but you must ensure that the plots you produce are not already available (for example, if you draw data from kaggle).

Deliverables:

The tex source file
The plot files as images
The data, either as a CSV file or a link to where it is available
A script that generates all the images that you use from the data
The PDF file generated from all the above
You will be graded by the quality of your story and how well do your plots supplement it.
