I wrote a makefile, which would use the gcc compiler to 
create an ELF 64 bit executable, "zipfilegen.out"
In the makefile, I defined a variable CC=gcc

Then I had a target named build, which had the dependencies on the 
three assembly files(.S).

To realise this target, I simply did 

--> gcc (file1.s) (file2.s) (file3.s) -o zipfilegen.out

This gave me the required executable.

The makefile also has a clean target, which basically cleans the 
executable formed.
