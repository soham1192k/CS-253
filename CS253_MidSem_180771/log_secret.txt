Once the executable ran along with the correct password,
I got a file named "secret.zip". I tried unzipping it, but it threw
an error. 
Then I tried to look for the file type.
file secret.zip--> JPEG image data.
So,it was clear that this was not a .zip
I googled how to view JPEG image data from the terminal.

I installed imagemagick
--> sudo apt-get install imagemagick

And then,

-->display secret.zip 

This gave out the message "CS253ROCKS".
